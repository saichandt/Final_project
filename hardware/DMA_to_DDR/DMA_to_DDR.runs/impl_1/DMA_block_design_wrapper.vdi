INFO: [DRC REQP-181] writefirst: Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (DMA_block_design_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_ENABLE_INDET_BTT_SF.I_INDET_BTT/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
